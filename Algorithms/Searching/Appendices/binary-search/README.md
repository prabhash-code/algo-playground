## Binary Search 🤔
The basic steps to perform Binary Search are:

1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Set the `low` index to the first element of the array and the `high` index to the last element.
3. Set the `middle` index to the average of the low and high indices.
4. If the element at the `middle` index is the `target` element, return the `middle` index.
5. If the `target` element is less than the element at the `middle` index, set the `high` index to the `middle` index – 1.
6. If the `target` element is greater than the element at the `middle` index, set the `low` index to the `middle` index + 1.
7. Repeat steps `3`-`6` until the element is found or it is clear that the element is not present in the array.
