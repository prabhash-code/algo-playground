## Question ðŸ¤”
Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a 
given `target` value.

If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

Example<br>
> Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8 <br>
> Output: [3,4]

When the question specifying the terms `sorted array` and `O(log n) time complexity`, obviously we know that we need the 
[Binary Search](../Appendices/binary-search/README.md) to solve this problem.
