## Bubble Sort ðŸ¤”
Bubble sort **compares two adjacent elements and swaps** them until they are in the intended order.

Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the array move to 
the end in each iteration. Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` on best case. `O(n^2)` on the average and worst cases.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` on the best, average and worst case scenarios.

### Bubble Sort Algorithm ðŸ™‹
```java
bubbleSort(array)
  for i <- 1 to indexOfLastUnsortedElement-1
    if leftElement > rightElement
      swap leftElement and rightElement
end bubbleSort
```
