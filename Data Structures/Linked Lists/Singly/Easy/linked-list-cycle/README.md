## Question ðŸ¤”
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached 
again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the 
index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed 
as a parameter**.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

> **Input**: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1<br>
> **Output**: true<br>
> **Explanation**: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

There are two solutions we provided.
01. This is straight forward solution. We are maintaining a `Set` that contains seen nodes and then keep checking 
against the current node in each iteration.
02. Secong one implement the  floyd's algorithm. 
    1. Basically here we are maintaining two pointers one moving slow and other one is fast.
    2. Then if a cycle has, the two pointers should meet at some point. (Notice that this meeting may be happening after 
       both pointers are go few rounds in the cycle. We cannot guaranty that when it's happening, hence we have to 
       iterate until they are met.)
